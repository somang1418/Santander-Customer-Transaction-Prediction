Bayesian Optimization is a probabilistic model based approach for finding the minimum of any function that returns a real-value metric. In the ipython notebook, I will utilize Bayesian Optimization function in order to find the optimal LGBM parameters in order to find the maximum AUC. If you cannot see it from the github, you can see it through [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/somang1418/tuning-hyperparameters-under-10-minutes-lgbm)
