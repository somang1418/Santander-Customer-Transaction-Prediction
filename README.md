### The Goal of the Competition:
To identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future and maximize the evaluation function (AUC)

### About the Analysis:
Bayesian Optimization is a probabilistic model based approach for finding the minimum of any function that returns a real-value metric. In the ipython notebook, I will utilize Bayesian Optimization function in order to find the optimal LGBM parameters to find the maximum AUC.
